                     <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                     <p>My interest in IT began when I was younger around the age of 13-15 when moving into high school being someone of a sportier, outdoors type person. My interest increased due to the recent global military use of computers and technology as well as the ever-pressing developments of IT and how it has pushed the world into a particular direction of the course of humanity.
                     <p>I choose to study at RMIT because I believed they had the better IT course compared to other university’s allowing studies to commence in this course I thought RMIT would provide me with the best opportunity to progress my studies in information technology and lead me to be able to land a successful job.
                     <p>My expectations during this course are mainly to push myself to completing the best possible work I can giving myself the best opportunity. Last year in year 12 I studied Software and I struggled with certain aspects of coding and learning and I believe if I really push myself I can truly succeed and learn more.

                    <p>What do these Results mean to you? These results don’t mean a great deal to me I’m sure in ways they are accurate in who I am and how mentally, psychologically, and physically I am in my life and how I think. However, I believe that I personally am in control of how I think and how I think today compared to a week or month or now is different and these results are not reflationary of what’s to come in my experiences of life and how I will change as a person and how I choose to challenge myself.
                    <p>How do these Results influence your behaviour in a team? These results state I’m more of an independent type of learner in the way I conduct myself and day to day living and I’ m more inclined to do things by myself. I disagree with that I’ve grown up playing in footy and cricket teams I believe I’m very capable of doing what is necessary to be done for the team and can do so and doing it well. These results don’t change that for me I believe I am capable and more inclined to work in teams and suite my role in a team.
                    <p>How should I take this into account when forming a team? In complete transparency I won’t take these results into account when forming a team, I believe in my own judgement and ability to place myself into a team and find a way to make it work and do what is needed. Working in teams is suiting roles and having good organisation and transparency to organise and conduct ourselves to complete a task. So these results won’t be taken into account in my judgement when forming a team.

                    <h1>Project Idea>
                     <h2>Overview>
                       <p>My Project Idea is to create and app which is designed to a beach rating system which is based around the level of pollution and sand as well as overall scenery of the beach. Beaches are very popularly globally but what sets the best from the rest. Based on popular opinions this app would set up a marking rating system which would rate beaches which can be done by the user. It would mark sand quality, water quality, scenery, pollution, overall grade, and ability to comment. This app would give people a chance to rate beaches, and this could be used for local governments around the world to see how their local beaches compare with the rest.
