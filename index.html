                     <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                     <h2>What is my interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Any Particular event Spark Interest? Outline of IT experience (If any)
                     <p>My interest in IT began when I was younger around the age of 13-15 when moving into high school being someone of a sportier, outdoors type person. My interest increased due to the recent global military use of computers and technology as well as the ever-pressing developments of IT and how it has pushed the world into a particular direction of the course of humanity. My IT experience is very limited although studying it in year 11 and 12 I also found the textbook side much easier then coding as such but really do enjoy studying.
                     <h2>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?
                     <p>I choose to study at RMIT because I believed they had the better IT course compared to other university’s allowing studies to commence in this course. I thought RMIT would provide me with the best opportunity to progress my studies in information technology and lead me to be able to land a successful job.
                     <h2>What do I expect to learn during my studies?
                     <p>My expectations during this course are mainly to push myself to completing the best possible work I can giving myself the best opportunity. Last year in year 12 I studied Software and I struggled with certain aspects of coding and learning, and I believe if I really push myself, I can truly succeed and learn more. As well in the course I’m looking to gain as much knowledge on IT security in the hope of when finishing the degree to get a job in cybersecurity. Hopefully this course will teach me all the aspects necessary that I will need to be familiar with in due course as starting out my knowledge is little to basic.

                    <h2>What do these Results mean to you? 
                     <p>These results don’t mean a great deal to me I’m sure in ways they are accurate in who I am and how mentally, psychologically, and physically I am in my life and how I think. However, I believe that I personally am in control of how I behave at times such as today compared to a week or month or now is different and these results are not reflationary of what’s to come in my experiences of life and how I will change as a person and what I choose to challenge myself with. 
                    <h2>How do these Results influence your behaviour in a team? 
                     <p>These results state I’m more of an individual learner and can be more observant and introverted then when being in a team environment speaking and communicating as well as doing are very crucial to success of the team. They also state I’m more empathetic and feeling as an individual which, I think can help me to help my teammates when I see are struggling give them support and help them keep going to make sure we complete the task.  They also state I’m more logical which I agree with I like time to think’s over with the team so that we can have a direct plan on how to approach tasks.
                    <h2>How should I take this into account when forming a team? 
                     <p>When forming a team, I will take these results into account when forming a team is making sure I speak up more and communicate with the group how I should be completing my work.  As well as continuing to use the current key strategies of pushing on when need to being an individual learner but being smart and tactical about it and making sure I bring my teammates with me and not leave them behind when completing work.

           <h1>Project Idea</h1>
           <h2>Overview
             <p>My Project Idea is to create and app which is a designed beach rating system which is based on what are the best overall beaches in Australia. Australia is known for their beaches, but which are the best and why?  Based on popular opinions this app would set up a marking rating system which would rate beaches which can be done by the user. It would mark sand quality, water quality, scenery, pollution, overall grade, and provide an ability to comment a written opinion. This app would give people a chance to rate beaches, and this could be used for local governments around Australia.
            
             <h2>Motivation
               <p>My motivation for this project idea was I was looking into relevant issues that could be used to create and app and would be manageable to complete timewise. I choose a beach rating system because they are being one of Australia’s iconic landmarks and places to see. The app would produce a rating system which would be easily accessible to complete. From my research there are no beach apps of Australia in the App store which is just about beaches this would therefore be a new designed app about Australian beaches and how they are currently viewed by Australians and what are viewed as the best.
               
               <h2>Description
                          <h3>1.Search Engine and Work with Google Maps
                            <p>The app would be built around a map this would be using the access to Google Maps which if you stay with google maps terms of service the platform can be used within the app. My idea for the app it would use Google Maps model of Australia and would highlight beaches. A search engine type could be sourced which would allow you to search beaches in specific but as well using the map search manually based on location using Google Maps’ provided search bases already.  This app would then have two ways of searching for the beaches and accessing them
                           
                            <h3>2.Layout
                              <p>The Layout of the app would be quite simple a search engine located at the top of the screen easily viewable and easy to access. Underneath that would be the Map of Australia which using your fingers on your phone you could zoom in and drag around manually locating the beach you are looking for. As well as below that would be the list of the TOP 10 voted beaches in Australia which are published by the app using the data submitted by users.
                           
                           <h3>3.How Surveying and Voting is Conducted
                             <p>The basis of the app is around discovering what is the best beach in Australia is and where the voting and surveying can be done and published. Using each beach in Australia when you tap on the beach by the app it would provide the surveying this is where you can enter provide the user’s opinion on the beach and what they think of it. It would provide you with a heading and small description of each criteria area being marked, (Sand Quality, Water Quality, Scenery, Pollution, Overall Grade). It would be graded out of 10 1 being dreadful/ disgusting and 10 being amazing/beautiful.
                            
                             <h3>4.Invidual Answer and Security
                               <p>This would all be done anonymous and would not require account details, email, phone number etc, the answers would remain anonymous. The results would be published an added to the already completed results on the beach then providing an average which can be then used for if it’s in the Top 10 beaches or not there would be no mention of individual responses and when comments appear under each beach it would simply show comment by a number and that number being the number of people who rated the beach. E.g., Reporter 50, “This beach is pretty cool but lots of trash!!!”  The intention of not involving and security account access or etc is because I simply see for the app I’m trying to make there is no need and best to keep it simple.
                           
                            <h3>5.Results
                              <p>The results of the app would be filter for in comments section would filter certain words that aren’t appropriate but every time a result is published it would be placed into a spreadsheet linked to a particular beach creating a database
                              
                              <h2>Skills Required
                                <p>Skills Required for this project will be needing to build and app and a friendly user-interface software will need to be written with a built-in click map of Australia this would be moveable and adjustable. It should link into google maps which can be used if it’s within google maps terms of service. A provided software service to build the app would be MIT app builder this should be tried and to see how if this would be sustainable in requirements and if it will suitable resolve the design and be successful. If MIT does not work a new app design skill will be required. 
                                
                                <h2>Outcome
                                  <p>The outcome of this project will result in a successful app in which you can direct by a map loading in the app to select a beach which you are at in Australia and select the beach you would like to rate and be able to give and provide a result. These results would then be able to be accessed by the public and too see how each beach is rated and how it is persevered. It will provide a new option for people to be able to give feedback about beaches around the country and provide travel goers a new option when deciding what beach to go to an be given a review of the process.
