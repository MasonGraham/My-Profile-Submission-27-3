                     <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                     <p>My interest in IT began when I was younger around the age of 13-15 when moving into high school being someone of a sportier, outdoors type person. My interest increased due to the recent global military use of computers and technology as well as the ever-pressing developments of IT and how it has pushed the world into a particular direction of the course of humanity.I choose to study at RMIT because I believed they had the better IT course compared to other university’s allowing studies to commence in this course I thought RMIT would provide me with the best opportunity to progress my studies in information technology and lead me to be able to land a successful job.My expectations during this course are mainly to push myself to completing the best possible work I can giving myself the best opportunity. Last year in year 12 I studied Software and I struggled with certain aspects of coding and learning and I believe if I really push myself I can truly succeed and learn more.
